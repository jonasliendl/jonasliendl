## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jonas
a young passionate Software Engineer from Berlin, Germany. Mainly, I develop applications as a Full-Stack Engineer, but I challenge myself and expand my knowledge by expanding into other branches of Computer Science and tech.</br>
Like my bachelor's thesis which I wrote about vision AI models in manufacturing quality assurance systems looking into a bunch of deep learning models in the vision AI space.</br>
The code and projects I share here on GitHub are private projects which I do besides my work as Software Engineer.
