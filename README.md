## Hey 👋
**I'm Jonas** - Currently I'm studying **💻 Computer Science** in the 6th semester at the **👨‍🎓 Berlin School of Economics & Law** in **🇩🇪 Berlin, Germany**. This study is part of the 👨‍💻 **Future Talent Program** at **Tesla** in Berlin, a collaboration between university and work in Germany called _"Dual Study"_.<br/>
Besides work and study, I'm evolving and expanding my skill set by working on private projects, accomplishing courses, and reading books.<br/>
My main focus and interest lays in **Embedded Systems**, **Vision AI**, **Autonomous Systems** like **Robotic Systems** and **Self-Driving Vehicles**, as well as **Backend Services**.<br/>
<br/><br/>
_Below, you can see my current skill set. In some languages or technologies, I'm more fluent than others. However, I can apply all of the skills down below to real-world use cases._
